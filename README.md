# CIS598 Project

## Project Description
The general idea for this project is that it allows you to take a problem that involves many mathematical
formulae and with as little effort as possible, input it into a program that will solve the equations
for you and spit out an answer. If you are working on a project that involves physical objects, it helps
bridge between having a physical model of something and the actual equations used for calculating
various things like length, mass, area, force, etc.
